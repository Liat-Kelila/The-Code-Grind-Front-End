Unsolved Problems: 
  Input / Edit / Delete is seemingly only functional upon the initial page load on Heroku. This seems to be an issue with Heroku deployment, and is not an issue locally. Another issue that can be solved with further styling specifications is that if you only add one item, it disturbs the styling/layout of another item. This issue disappears when you add yet another item. This is because the images are in two columns and one item will get dispursed between two columns until there is once again an even number of items. 


User Story:
  Entering the website, user is greeted by a dispaly of the coffee shop's drinks menu, with a background image of the coffee shop. Coffee shop is titled with The Code Grind. Each item has a dropdown tag which allows user to view more information regarding the item. Beneath this information, there are two more dropdown tags, which are meant for employees to be able to edit and/or delete an item. The delete dropdown gives a delete button - this allows to ensure that item isn't accidentally deleted by giving two steps in the process. Editing provides an edit form, for each property value to be edited individually. Page refreshes upon submission. In addition, there is a suggestion box for employees / users to input a new item.
